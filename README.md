# firefly-pte-spider

Firefly provide very good source of learning material.

The front-end they provide is a bit strange. And there service is sometimes at fautly.

I wrote this python script to provide more customizeable reading access to the resources.

This project will be stop updating as I hit the 79!

I am at 64 now -- 21 Oct 2019
